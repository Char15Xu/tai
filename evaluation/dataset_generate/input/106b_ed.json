        "text": "Hi everyone! We’re so excited to have you in EECS C106B/206B! This class dives into open research problems, building off the foundation established by 106A/206A. We cover much more cutting-edge topics and aim to build skills in analysis, writing, and experimentation.\n\nJust like 106A/206A, we’ll be sending out weekly announcements with important information. Please read these to avoid missing any important class information!\n\nThe class is split up into a few different parts. We will have weekly lectures, discussion sections, and journal clubs along with biweekly homework and projects. As mentioned in lecture today, instead of 3-hour labs, we have 1-hour journal clubs meant to introduce projects (which are completed in your own time) and conduct paper presentations. There will also be a research-based final project. All parts of the class can be done asynchronously except the journal clubs, which have mandatory attendance. This is a link to today's logistics presentation in class.\n\nGeneral Course Info:\n\nCourse Website Link: https://ucb-ee106.github.io/106b-sp24site/\n\nSave this link! Lecture topics are subject to change. We want to cover as much information on the horizon of robotics as possible, so some classes may be shifted around.\n\nThe Gradescope entry code is WBZ7DE. Everyone should be added, but if not you can add yourself to the course with that code. \n\nEd is our home for questions and communications.\n\nIf you are a DSP student, please ensure that your DSP letter has been sent to the class so that we can provide you with any accommodations you need.\n\nIf you are a waitlist student, please know that we're trying our best to get definite answers regarding enrollment, but we don't know any additional definite information (ie possibility of expansion, etc.) about enrollment than what's already been mentioned. \n\nIf you haven't taken 106A, an assessment will be released tomorrow on the course website and Gradescope. Completion of this assessment is required if you haven't taken 106A. This is a great benchmark for whether you have the foundational background to succeed in this class. \n\nDiscussion Sections\n\nDiscussion sections will be on Thursday from 4-5pm (Cory 299) and Friday from 11am-12pm (Cory 521), led by either Tarun or Nima.\n\nThey will have a review of important topics and go over practice problems related to the material to supplement lecture content.\n\nOne of the sections will be recorded and posted to the website for asynchronous viewing.\n\nJournal Club\n\nDuring journal club, we will have two paper presentations per day, done in groups of two (the signup form will be posted next week). Also, any new projects will be introduced.\n\nJournal club must be attended synchronously, and it begins next week. Tomorrow at 8 pm, we will send out a form to write preferences for a particular section.\n\n\nProjects/Labs\n\nProjects will be done in groups of 3 people, and they happen during your own time. Through this system, we hope to build skills that allow you to perform more effective research. The submission for each project involves a conference-style report.\n\nWe have a reservation system for the robots like the final project last semester (see the course website for the links). A robot can be reserved for 2 hours at a time, and a new reservation can be made after the current one is finished.\n\nFeel free to come to lab OH for help on projects.\n\nProject 0 will be released tomorrow. It's optional (and doesn't have a due date) but it's highly recommended as ROS refresher.\n\nBefore using the lab robots, you must complete the Robot Usage Quiz on Gradescope (same as last semester). \n\nHomework\n\nHomework is used to build a better understanding of the material through practice problems. You're generally going to have 2 weeks to do each homework, except for Homework 1 that's due next Wednesday. It's already released on the website, and a thread will be created here on Ed, as well. \n\nMidterm\n\nWe will have one midterm (which will happen pretty close to the end of the semester).\n\nWe don’t want this to be too stressful and will design it accordingly. More details will be released closer to the exam date.\n\nFinal Project\n\nEveryone will have to do a research-based final project. This will be in groups of 4.\n\nExcited for the semester!!:)\n\n\n\n",

Welcome back to another installment of 106B announcements:) My update is this weekend, I went on a retreat near Yosemite, and it was fun!\n\nHere’s what’s happening this week in 106B:\n\nTuesday - Project 1 will be released in the evening. Please use the robot calendars to book time on the Sawyers. Here's the Sawyer Robot Calendar, also available on the policies tab of the website. You will have 1 week to do this project, but it'll be a lot shorter than the upcoming longer projects.\n\nWednesday - Homework 1 is due! If you require DSP assignment extensions, we will be contacting you ASAP.\n\nThursday - Homework 2 will be released! You will have 2 weeks to do this homework.\n\nThursday \u0026 Friday - We’ll have a discussion on stability on Thursday/Friday by Tarun!\n\nWednesday to Friday - We have journal club starting this week. It’ll be an intro to how journal club works and an opportunity to ask any questions about Project 1. \n\nThese are the journal club assignments. Attending journal club is a key component of this class. If your assigned journal club slot absolutely doesn’t work for you, please make a private post on Ed about it ASAP including your email address \u0026 times you are available. Thanks!\n\nPaper presentation sign-ups will be released shortly. Each person will be required to sign up for 2 papers. We’ll go over this requirement in journal club, so please don’t worry about this if it doesn’t make sense yet!\n\nMonday to Friday - Office Hours start from this week! Please come to our office hours to utilize all the available resources in this class. It’s a great way for you to get deeper on the content, or ask any project questions. (If you missed homework/project party today, you should stop by next week!)\n\nFriday - 106A assessment due for those who are taking the course without having taken 106A before.\n\nThat’s it, everybody! See you at lecture this week, where we’ll be talking about controls (quadrotors, linear control, Lyapunov, and more).\n\nP.S.  This class can be a lot with things to keep up with, so don't hesitate to ask any questions and get help! Also, there may be a couple few things that I need to update on the website still (dates and links), I'm working on getting to those super soon!",

Sorry about the late release of Project 1, I have been fighting a terrible cough all day and just dragged myself out of bed for the past couple hours. \n\nThis is a link to the lab doc: https://ucb-ee106.github.io/106b-sp24site/assets/proj/proj1.pdf (parts of the website are still being updated, please be patient over the next two days since I'm trying my best while ill).\n\nAs noted on the doc, this project is due next week, on Friday 2/2. This is supposed to be a short lab to introduce you to working with the Sawyers a little bit beyond Lab 7 from 106A.\n\nTo do this lab, you'll have to book time on the Sawyer robots. Before you book Amir, please note that the setup is slightly worse than the other robots. So please try to book other robots if they're available.\n\nPlease remember the ground rules of the lab (no eating/drinking, use cntrl+c \u0026 pkill -u $(whoami) when logging out, put hand on e-stop, etc etc) and the booking rules for the robots -- only 2 hours of bookings on the calendar at a time. If we notice that you're booking more than this or not following any of the rules listed in the Robot Usage Guide, you will immediately fail this project. The same goes for if you don't finish the robot usage quiz on Gradescope before you start the project. \n\nA gradescope assignment will be released shortly for submission. \n\nJournal club starts from Wednesday (technically, today, since it's so late now). Please show up as attendance will be taken and you'll have the opportunity to ask any questions about the project and/or other parts of the class. If you have to miss journal club for any reason, please email your GSI directly, they can grant you an excused absence. ",

Here are the guidelines regarding the assignment deadline extension accommodation: \n\nDue to your DSP accommodations, you will be given a 2-day extension for each homework and project assignment. As a result, you will not need to rely on any slip days for that. Unfortunately, you won't be able to apply additional slip days on top of this 2-day extension since we aim to release solutions 2 days after the homework is due. If you need a longer project extension, we may be able to accommodate it if any circumstances arise, which will need to be communicated to us promptly. However, we encourage you to submit it sooner as otherwise, it can be easy to fall behind and project time will cut into the final project.\n\nSo, your homework deadlines will be on Fridays instead of Wednesdays. For example, tonight's homework 1 will be due on Friday (1/26). Your project deadlines will be on Sundays instead of Fridays, so Project 1 will be due on Sunday (2/4). I hope this clarifies how the assignment extensions will work for your DSP accommodation! Let me know if you have any questions. ",

Details below.\n\nTitle: Flying Robots: Exploring Hybrid Locomotion and Physical Interaction\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Raphael Zufferey\n\nLocation: 540AB Cory Hall. A link to the webcast will be provided before the seminar.\n\nTime: 4-5 PM PT, Monday, January 29, 2024\n\nAbstract:\n\nAutonomous flying robots have become widespread in recent years, yet their capability to interact with the environment remains limited. Moving in multiple fluids is one of the great challenges of mobile robotics, and carries great potential for application in biological and environmental studies. In particular, hybrid locomotion provides the means to cross large distances and obstacles or even change from one body of water to another thanks to flight. At the same time, they are capable of operating underwater, collecting samples, video and aquatic metrics. However, the challenges of operating in both air and water are complex. In this talk, we will introduce these challenges and cover several research solutions which aim to address these in different modalities, depending on locomotion and objectives. Bio-inspiration plays a crucial role in these solutions, and the topic of flapping flight in the context of physical interaction will also be presented.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Raphael Zufferey received his PhD in Aeronautics from Imperial College London, UK in 2020. He is currently a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow at EPFL, Switzerland. His main research interests are in novel, integrated robotic systems that aim to address difficult locomotion and interaction tasks, covering questions relating to fluid dynamics, mechanical design, embedded electronics and control. In particular, hybridizing flight in small-scale robots has been one of his core topics of investigation. Raphael was also a researcher at Harvard and University of Seville. He was awarded the best PhD in Robotics UK award for his accomplishments.",

In the definition of an energy like function v(X) that is locally positive definite is 1) that v(0,t) = 0 for all t and 2) v(x,t) is greater than or equal to a different function alpha based on the magnitude of x that is strictly increasing and continuous. In the solution I don't see where condition 2 is being met or why we are proving that v \u003e= 0 since 0 is not a function that is strictly increasing and based on the magnitude of x. On an earlier example, we proved LPD by proving that v(x,t) was greater than a function e.v min * magnitude of x^2 but I don't see where this applies to this solution. Would someone be able to explain why we are using 0 as our alpha function here? Thank you!",

Since h(q) = 0 is an algebraic constraint, we can find another function, say h_2(q1, ..., qn-1) such that h_2(q1, ..., qn-1) = qn.

        "text": "Lecture on Thursday will be in Banatao Auditorium (Sutardja Dai Hall) from 2 to 3 pm, followed by a talk by NYU Prof. Giuseppe Loianno from 3 to 4 pm! This special lecture will not be recorded.\n\nAbstract for the talk: Autonomous mobile robots will play a critical role in addressing diverse time-sensitive and hazardous tasks across various application scenarios. These include logistics, reconnaissance, search and rescue missions, monitoring, transportation, space missions, and construction. Future smart cities will need to reconsider their current transportation and delivery systems. Small-scale aerial and ground robots will navigate in dense urban environments to deliver in a timely manner various items. To handle these challenges effectively, robots must demonstrate the ability to execute agile maneuvers and collaborate efficiently within unknown, uncertain, and confined spaces. In this talk, I will discuss several recent research results on developing Super Autonomous or USARC: Unmanned, Small, Agile, Resilient, and Collaborative robots. Achieving this goal requires reimagining the existing perception-action paradigm governing robot autonomy. This involves shifting the existing paradigm from a sequential to a concurrent approach by combining in a principled manner physics-based and data-driven techniques across modeling, perception, learning, and control. This will result in an architecture which proactively and continuously improves its navigation performances and that naturally scales to multi-robot settings by leveraging data from multiple agents. Consequently, this will boost agility, resilience, and improve both individual and collaborative decentralized decision-making processes for small-scale robots.\n\nBio: Giuseppe Loianno is currently an Assistant Professor at the New York University, New York, NY, USA, and the Director of the Agile Robotics and Perception Lab (https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) working on autonomous robots. Prior to joining NYU, he was a Research Scientist and Team Leader with GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. He has authored or coauthored more than 70 conference papers, journal papers, and book chapters. His research interests include perception, learning, and control for autonomous robots. Dr. Loianno is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award, the DARPA Young Faculty Award, the IROS Toshio Fukuda Young Professional Award in 2022, Conference Editorial Board Best Associate Editor Award at ICRA 2022, and Best Reviewer Award at ICRA 2016. He is senior editor for IROS 2023-2025 and IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters as well as an associate editor for multiple other robotics journals including IEEE Transactions on Robotics, International Journal of Robotics Research, Field Robotics, and Frontiers in Robotics and AI. He is chair of the IEEE RAS Robotics Foundations cluster and the IEEE RAS TC on Aerial Robotics and Unmanned Aerial Systems. He was the General Chair of the IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics (SSRR) in 2021 as well as Program Chair in 2019, 2020, and 2022. His work has been featured in a large number of renowned international news and magazines such as IEEE Spectrum, Popular Science, Scientific American, TechCrunch, MIT Technological Review, and Quartz.

I don't think I'm going back anytime soon lol. On the other hand, I got to see the sphere up close, which was very cool! \n\nA few announcements: \n\nThere's an interesting talk happening tomorrow Tuesday 2/27 from 4-5 pm in 430 Soda Hall by MIT PhD Candidate Michael West, Jr. titled \"All models are wrong, simple models are insightful: A study of human manipulation\" -- goes hand in hand (haha get it) with all this grasping stuff. \n\nAs you probably already know, Homework 3 is due tonight! By the way, (and I'm sorry I have to say it but) please make sure that you're turning in your own work. Going through the homework with your own effort (and additional help during OH/HW Party) is crucial to getting the most out of the course. \n\nProject 2 is due tomorrow night! Just a reminder that you shouldn't have to deal with any singularity-related implementations with the sinusoidal controller - please just discuss why it is occurring and the methodology with which you'd solve it in the report.\n\nProjects 3 (Grasping) and 4 (State Estimation) will be released on Wednesday. We're updating them significantly from previous years, so it'll be fun. Plus, we'll have a special extra credit opportunity (more TBA).\n\nHere's the best news that I hope will make your week: the midterm has been switched back to take-home since the problems we tackle in this class really push the envelope.

I spent yesterday holed up in the Vegas airport after my 7 am flight got canceled after my conference. I don't think I'm going back anytime soon lol. On the other hand, I got to see the sphere up close, which was very cool! \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eA few announcements: \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003clist style=\"bullet\"\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThere's an interesting talk happening tomorrow Tuesday 2/27 from 4-5 pm in 430 Soda Hall by MIT PhD Candidate Michael West, Jr. titled \"All models are wrong, simple models are insightful: A study of human manipulation\" -- goes hand in hand (haha get it) with all this grasping stuff. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eAs you probably already know, Homework 3 is due tonight! By the way, (and I'm sorry I have to say it but) please make sure that you're turning in your own work. Going through the homework with your own effort (and additional help during OH/HW Party) is crucial to getting the most out of the course. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eProject 2 is due tomorrow night!

(I promise this is not a late April fools joke or anything like that!) As a result, here are some administrative items related to that:\n\nWe will have a synchronous journal club next week (this is different from what was announced on Monday). If you're signed up to present, please be ready.\n\nWe will have a discussion next week - we'll be going through a special vision problem that was going to be on the midterm! You should plan to go to discussion next week, as we'll be taking attendance as well. \n\nWe will be having a small homework 6 on optimal control and RL.\n\nSecondly, HW 5 is released and due on April 16th, please use these threads for questions:\n\nProblem 1\n\nProblem 2\n\nProblem 3\n\nProblem 4\n\nWe'll release mini-project 5 and final project specifications tomorrow! The deadlines for these two assignments will remain unchanged. Hope you have a great rest of your evening:)",

However, this special seminar will feature a new talk by Prof. Ken Goldberg!\n\nThis talk will be held in person on the 8th floor of Berkeley Way West (BWW) at 11:10 am on Wednesday and will be followed by pizza in the kitchen of BWW8 for those who attend the talk. \n\nWe encourage those of you who are local to attend in person. However, if you are unable to attend in person, you can join the seminar here (passcode 443084). \n\nThis Wednesday, 4/24/24's speaker is Prof. Ken Goldberg, and he will present a new talk, only given once before at Stanford University. \n\nTitle: Data is All You Need (?): Large Robot Action Models and Good Old Fashioned Engineering\n\nAbstract: 2024 is off to an exciting start with enormous enthusiasm for humanoids and other robots based on recent advances in \"end-to-end\" large robot action models. Initial results are promising, and several collaborative efforts are underway to collect the needed demonstration data. But is data all you need? I'll present my view of the status quo in terms of manipulation task definition, data collection, and experimental evaluation. I'll then suggest that to reach expected performance levels, it may be helpful for the community to reconsider good old fashioned engineering in terms of modularity, metrics, and failure analysis. I'll present MANIP, a new framework for incorporating engineering that shows promise for tasks such as cable untangling, surgical suturing, and bagging.\n\n\nI welcome feedback: this will be the second time I present this talk (I presented it on 19 April at Stanford), and I expect it to be a bit controversial ;)\n\nBio: Ken Goldberg (IEEE Fellow, 2005) is William S. Floyd Distinguished Chair of Engineering at UC Berkeley and Chief Scientist of Ambi Robotics and Jacobi Robotics. Ken leads research in robotics and automation: grasping, manipulation, and learning for applications in warehouses, industry, homes, agriculture, and robot-assisted surgery. He is Professor of IEOR with appointments in EECS and Art Practice. Ken is Chair of the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Steering Committee (60 faculty) and is co-founder and Editor-in-Chief emeritus of the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE).

There’s no project or homework party tonight but more hours will be added later this week. Please feel free to stop by to talk about final projects or anything else on your mind!\n\nIt’s the last week of journal club as well — if you’ve signed up for a journal club next week, please be sure to still submit your presentation to gradescope, or email it to your Lab TA if it’s extra credit. Also, last week was the last week of discussions (so no discussion this week)!\n\nFinal Project Presentation Slot Sign Up! Please fill this out by Wednesday, 5/24 at 11:59pm. Only one person in the group needs to fill this out.\n\nHere’s our end of semester feedback form… please complete it!

Have you checked these? Might be helpful:\n\nThe error message you're encountering, \"Invalid number in NLP function or derivative detected\", typically indicates that there are NaN (Not a Number) or Inf (Infinity) values being produced during the evaluation of your optimization problem. This can happen due to several reasons related to the formulation of your problem or the numerical properties of the solver and model. Here are some steps and checks you can perform to troubleshoot and hopefully resolve this issue:\n\nInitial Values: The error messages suggest that there's a NaN detected at a specific point during the Jacobian evaluation. Check your initial values to ensure they are feasible and within a reasonable range. NaN or Inf values can occur if the initial values lead to undefined operations (like division by zero).\n\nScaling of Variables: Sometimes, very large or very small values of variables or parameters can lead to numerical instability in solvers like Ipopt. Make sure your variables are scaled properly. This means that typical values used in calculations should be close to 1 if possible.\n\nBounds and Constraints: Review the bounds on your variables and the constraints in your model. Ensure that all constraints are correctly implemented and that there are no contradictions or impossible conditions. An unbounded variable or poorly defined constraint can lead to extreme values that result in numerical errors.\n\nDerivatives and Jacobians: Since the error specifically mentions the Jacobian of equality and inequality constraints, make sure that these derivatives are correctly defined. If you are providing analytical derivatives, verify their correctness. Alternatively, consider using automatic differentiation if supported by CasADi, to avoid manual errors.\n\nSolver Settings: Adjusting solver settings can sometimes help manage numerical difficulties. You can try changing parameters related to step size, tolerance, or even switching between exact and approximate derivative calculations in the Ipopt settings.\n\nModel Simplification: Temporarily simplify your model by reducing the number of variables or constraints, or by solving a simplified version of the problem. This can help isolate the source of the numerical issues.\n\nUse opti.debug.value: As suggested in the error message, use the opti.debug.value method to inspect the values of variables at the point where the solver fails. This can give you insight into which variables or constraints are causing the problem.\n\nCheck CasADi and Ipopt versions: Ensure that your versions of CasADi and Ipopt are compatible and that you are using versions without known bugs that might affect your problem.\n\nHere's a brief example of how you might use opti.debug.value to inspect the problematic values:\n\n# Assuming `opti` is your CasADi Opti instance\ntry:\n    sol = opti.solve()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Solver failed:\", str(e))\n    # Print debug information for all variables\n    for v in opti.variable():\n        print(v, opti.debug.value(v))\n\n\nImplement these checks and modifications to see if the problem persists. If issues continue, you might want to consider consulting more detailed logs or discussions specific to CasADi and Ipopt for additional diagnostic strategies.",

In total, you won't spend more than 20 minutes presenting.\n\nThe final presentation schedule is here.  Please reach out to other groups to switch your presentation slot (and if you agree on a switch, please send me an email with both groups CC'd). If it's an extremely extenuating circumstance, please reach out to me directly, and I'll see what we can do, but the timing for presentations will be extremely tight. \n\nWe'll also release a project peer evaluation form if you're experiencing any issues with your group (or have experienced issues with your past project groups).\n\n[VERY IMPORTANT] We'll have refreshments for both days of the final project! Please fill out this form for food ordering. You may only order something for one slot (ideally your presentation slot). It's due Sunday, 4/28 at 11:59 pm. \n\nFinally, I just wanted to note that most of the weightage for this project will be on your final report, so please don't stress toooo much about the presentation (I know it can be very stressful)! We're just looking forward to seeing the results you have so far:) \n\nIt's a rough part of the semester, so please be sure to take care of yourself!
